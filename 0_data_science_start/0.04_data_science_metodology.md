### Data requirements
What data do you need to solve that question.

### Data collection

Does the data represent the problem asked by the user.

### Data preparation
What work is required to use the date in a what that bring solution to life.

### Modeling
When you apply the visualisation is the answer visible.

Does the data model answer the asked question or must the model be adjusted 

### Deployment
Can a model put into practice.

### Feedback
