# Data Science methodology
##### Data science is a multidisciplinary field combining, statistics, technology, and domain expertise in order to extract information from data

##### Sinse datasets can be large it is difficult to decide what information can be extracted from data and how should it be done. There fore a data science methodology was developed.

##### Data science methodology includes data collection, measurement strategies and comparison of analysis methods relative to different goals and situations.

###### Example of general data science methodology

 ### Business understanding
 What is the problem you are trying to solve.
The client describes current state of afairs. What happened and what is happening? The goal is to clearly define vital questions. Understand the goal of the person asking the question.


### Analytic approach
How can you use data to answer that question.
This can men many things. Most often there is one of tree ways to approach this problem.
* Try to predict the outcome
* Use descriptive model to find correlations
* Classify the data set (used most often on yes/no problems)
It is vital to define what type of pattern needs to be addressed.  
  
### Data requirements
What data do you need to solve that question. A common approach is to use 6w questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How?).

### Data collection 
Where is the data coming from and how will you receive the data. Some times small dataset is fine in other cases it is not sufficient. Data set is evaluated using visualisation of the data and descriptive statistics. Gaps in the data need to be identified and they need to be substituted or filled. It is common for data scientist to avoid making decisions based on questions that do not yet have a valid dataset and to focus on the questions that do. The answer to the unanswered questions can be acquired at the later stage when the data is collected.

### Data understanding
Does the data represent the problem asked by the user.

### Data preparation
What work is required to use the date in a what that bring solution to life.

### Modeling
When you apply the visualisation is the answer visible.

### Evaluation 
Does the data model answer the asked question or must the model be adjusted 

### Deployment
Can a model put into practice.

### Feedback 
Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholders to answer the question.
