## data science categories
The bast way to look at this is thrue a layer system.

    Execution Enviroment: Special software setting the code is running in. Example: Python virtual enviroment, docker.
    
    Data Asset Management: manages, organizes data. It creactes backups and manages user rights.
    
    Data Management: collecting, parsing and retreving data. Data is collected from mupltiple diferent saurces.

    Data Integration and Transformation (ETL): extracts, transforms, and loads the data. Data is often stored in diferent location on diferent types devices. Data Trandformation is a process of transforming the values ,structure and format of data. Data is then loaded in a way best suted for the intended use case.

    Data Visualisation: Using graphical representation the data is inspected with intent of finding information and deciding whch method to continue work on the project. This is usualy done with charts, plots, maps, animation ect. Data visualisation conveys data more efectivly.
    
    Model Building: referes to step regarding training the machine learning model or analyzing paterns using statistycal algorithms.

    Model Deployment: referes to applying the trained model (or formula derived from previous data) in production enviroment. This can be done in multiply way. One of the common onse is API programs.

    Model Monitoring and Assessment: checks model robustness and accuracy.

    Code Asset Management: manages code created for the deployment of the project. User has access to the assets of the project. Example: github.

    Development Enviroment: IDEs, and other tools used to compile, test etc. software.
